"""A1-3: hybrid search (FTS5 + sqlite-vec) with RRF fusion.

``hybrid_search`` is the search entry-point used by ``observation_search``.
Behaviour:

1. Always run an FTS5 query (existing keyword path).
2. If ``VECTOR_SEARCH_AVAILABLE`` is False, or embedding the query yields
   ``None``, or the ``obs_vectors`` table is missing, return FTS results
   untouched — full backwards compatibility.
3. Otherwise run a k-NN query against ``obs_vectors`` and fuse both rank
   lists with Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF, k=60, the reference constant
   from Cormack et al. 2009).

All helpers here are deliberately DB-agnostic with respect to how the
rows arrive — callers pass the SQL connection and the filter fragments,
which keeps the quarantine / type / project_root logic centralised at
one call-site in ``observation_search``.
